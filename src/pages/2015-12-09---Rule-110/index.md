In the not-to-distant future I hope to expand this into a blog post about elementary cellular automata and Rule 110 in particular. For the moment feel free to fiddle around with the super simple elementary cellular automata runner below. You can check out the source code and readme [on GitHub](https://github.com/hankmccoy/ca-sim). Also feel free to check out the [fullscreen version](http://ca-sim.thomasbeirne.com).
