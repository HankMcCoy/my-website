Below is my implementation of a quick minesweeper rip-off. You can check out the source code and readme [on GitHub](https://github.com/hankmccoy/minesweeper). I implemented this as a very simple React app using Babel and core-js for ES6 transpilation and webpack for script and style bundling.

<div class="minesweeper-container" style="width:350px;max-width:100%;height:430px"></div>
<span id="embed-script" data-script="https://raw.githack.com/HankMcCoy/minesweeper/master/dist/index.js" />
